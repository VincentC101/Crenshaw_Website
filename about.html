                <p>Hey, I'm a student currently at the University of Chicago studying Computer Science and History. I also love clothes and 
                    fashion in general, and thus I have this little website. The index tab just shows some clothing items/ accessories that 
                    I would want to purchace at some point in my life, regardless of my ability to afford it. Depending on how frequently I 
                    update it, it could be something of a wishlist. 
                </p>
                <p>This is a picture of me. I was trying to figure out how to create an oval cutout of an image. So there's my picture cutout in an oval.
                    I think it's a pleasant photo, really.
                    I also want to make sure the text wraps around the oval. Excuse me for the filler text. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 
                    In sodales faucibus mauris quis lacinia. Fusce fringilla ante congue, hendrerit enim sit amet, viverra dui. Aliquam ante lacus, pellentesque ut 
                    pharetra a, efficitur eget magna. Sed massa neque, lacinia in neque ut, convallis maximus urna. Suspendisse vitae mollis sapien.
                </p>
                <p>Sick, it does indeed wrap.
                </p>
                <p> Anyway, the main purpose of this website is for me to categorize some of my favorite outfits while also practicing web development
                    at the same time. The collections has seen multiple updates, and will likely see more in the future. As I find good outfits of mine, 
                    and (more importantly) remember to either take a picture of myself on that day or to take a picture of the outfit on the floor, they 
                    will be added to the collection. It's honestly difficult to remember to take a picture of my outfit. 
                </p>
                <p> There's also my youtube linked for some reason, really just to practice putting links in images. It just has baseball recruiting videos. 
                    Also Spotify!
                </p>
                <p> Added thought- eventually may get around to also using this as a system to keep track of the books I read, although this definitely has less of a practical
                    purpose as there's already stuff that does this. Oh well, we'll see.
